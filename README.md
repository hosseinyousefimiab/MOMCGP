# Composite Plate Optimization with Parallelized SEM Framework
 
This repository contains a set of advanced, production-level MATLAB codes for **parallelized multi-objective optimization of composite plates and stiffened panels** using the Spectral Element Method (SEM).  
The scripts are designed for high-throughput optimization, leveraging heavy parallelization, intelligent batch/memoization strategies, and efficient coupling with external optimizers.

`single_objective_parallel_solver.m` and `multi_objective_parallel_solver.m` can compete with Matlab's NS-GA II in computational time.
`highlevel_single_objective_parallel_solver.m` and `highlevel_multi_objective_parallel_solver.m` show approximately 50% improvement in computational time comparting to NS-GA II.
## üöÄ Overview

- **Structural Types:** Laminated constant stiffness plates, stiffened panels (various configurations)
- **Objectives:** Natural frequency maximization, weight minimization (multi-objective)
- **Parallelization:** All evaluations run distributed via MATLAB's Parallel Toolbox
- **Caching:** Caching/memoization to avoid redundant computation (DataHash-based)
- **External Optimization:** Integrated with evolutionary algorithms (MOMCGP)
- **Extensible:** Modular code structure, easy to adapt for new element layouts or objectives

## üóÇÔ∏è File Structure

Each major code corresponds to a specific optimization scenario (different mesh, layout, or objective):

## üìã How to Run

1. **Dependencies:**  
   - MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox  
   - `DataHash.m` in your working directory  
   - Mesh files (e.g., `conn_case1`, `nodes_case1`)
   - Optimizer binaries (`CEGA.exe`, `NoLayerPatchGA.exe`)

2. **Basic workflow:**
   - Edit `num_cores` at the top of each script for your machine.
   - Start MATLAB and run your desired case script:
     ```matlab
     run('single_objective_parallel_solver.m')
     ```
   - All logging will be saved to `optimization_parallel.log` and results in `Results.txt`.

3. **For Linux clusters:**  
   - Replace any `.exe` calls (e.g., `system('CEGA.exe')`) with Python or compatible scripts as needed.
   - Use appropriate SLURM/job scheduler commands if running on HPC.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Script Details

### 1. `single_objective_parallel_solver.m`  
- **Purpose:** Single-objective frequency optimization for a different panel topology.
- **Features:**  
  - parallelization, and detailed logging of results.
  - Only frequency is calculated and written.
  - Suitable as a template for adding new objectives or layouts.

### 2. `multi_objective_parallel_solver.m`  
- **Purpose:** Parallelized multi-objective optimization (frequency & weight) for a composite plate + stiffeners layout.
- **Features:**  
  - Processes `TestPoints.txt` generated by CEGA in batches.
  - parallelization, and detailed logging of results.
  - Calculates frequency (via SEM eigenvalue analysis) and structural weight .
  - Results: Each row in `Results.txt` contains `[frequency, weight]`.
 
### 3. `highlevel_multi_objective_parallel_solver.m`
- **Purpose:** highly parallelized and efficient single-objective optimization for a composite plate + stiffeners layout.

- **Features:**
  - **Dual-objective evaluation:** Computes both the fundamental natural frequency (via spectral element eigenanalysis) with geometry calculated from actual stacking sequences and ply counts.
  - **Automated batching:** Groups candidate designs so that only one design group (plate or any one stiffener) changes within each batch, maximizing the reuse of expensive computations.
  - **Memoization:** Uses `DataHash` to cache matrix and eigenproblem results, drastically reducing redundant computation across generations.
  - **Extensive precomputation:** Precomputes all possible positional arrangements for group activation/inactivation, enabling near-instant lookups during evaluation.
  - **Results:** Each row in `Results.txt` contains `[frequency]`.
  - **Logging:** All major operations are timestamped and saved to `optimization_parallel.log`. Generation-best results (if present) are appended to `Optimum_processed.txt`.
  - **Extensible:** Straightforward to add further objectives, modify for other groupings, or adapt to periodic/metamaterial panel layouts.
  - **approximately 50% improvement in computational time
