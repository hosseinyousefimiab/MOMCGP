# Composite Plate Optimization with Parallelized SEM Framework

Welcome!  
This repository contains a set of advanced, production-level MATLAB codes for **parallelized multi-objective optimization of composite plates and stiffened panels** using the Spectral Element Method (SEM).  
The scripts are designed for high-throughput optimization, leveraging heavy parallelization, intelligent batch/memoization strategies, and efficient coupling with external optimizers.

## 🚀 Overview

- **Structural Types:** Laminated constant stiffness plates, stiffened panels (various configurations)
- **Objectives:** Natural frequency maximization, weight minimization (multi-objective)
- **Parallelization:** All evaluations run distributed via MATLAB's Parallel Toolbox
- **Caching:** Caching/memoization to avoid redundant computation (DataHash-based)
- **External Optimization:** Integrated with evolutionary algorithms (MOMCGP)
- **Extensible:** Modular code structure, easy to adapt for new element layouts or objectives

## 🗂️ File Structure

Each major code corresponds to a specific optimization scenario (different mesh, layout, or objective):

| Script                                         | Description                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `single_objective_parallel_solver.m`           | single-objective optimization for stiffened panel                  |
| `multi_objective_parallel_solver.m`            | multi-objective  optimization for stiffened panel                  |
| `highlevel_single_objective_parallel_solver.m` | highly efficient single-objective optimization for stiffened panel |
| `highlevel_multi_objective_parallel_solver.m`  | highly efficient multi-objective optimization for stiffened panel  |
| `DataHash.m`                                   | Utility for fast hash-based memoization (required for caching)     |
| `CEGA.exe`                                     | External optimization algorithm: MOMCGP                            |

## 📋 How to Run

1. **Dependencies:**  
   - MATLAB Parallel Computing Toolbox  
   - `DataHash.m` in your working directory  
   - Mesh files (e.g., `conn_case1`, `nodes_case1`)
   - Optimizer binaries (`CEGA.exe`, `NoLayerPatchGA.exe`)

2. **Basic workflow:**
   - Edit `num_cores` at the top of each script for your machine.
   - Start MATLAB and run your desired case script:
     ```matlab
     run('case1_optimization.m')
     ```
   - All logging will be saved to `optimization_parallel.log` and results in `Results.txt`.

3. **For Linux clusters:**  
   - Replace any `.exe` calls (e.g., `system('CEGA.exe')`) with Python or compatible scripts as needed.
   - Use appropriate SLURM/job scheduler commands if running on HPC.

## ⚙️ Script Details

### 1. `case1_optimization.m`  
- **Purpose:** Parallelized multi-objective optimization (frequency & weight) for a composite plate + stiffeners layout.
- **Features:**  
  - Processes `TestPoints.txt` generated by CEGA in batches.
  - For each batch, identifies which design group (plate/stiffener) changes and only recalculates what’s needed.
  - Caches static contributions for maximal efficiency.
  - Calculates frequency (via SEM eigenvalue analysis) and structural weight on-the-fly.
  - Results: Each row in `Results.txt` contains `[frequency, weight]`.

### 2. `case4_optimization.m`  
- **Purpose:** Single-objective frequency optimization for a different panel topology.
- **Features:**  
  - Same batching, parallelization, and caching strategies as above.
  - Only frequency is calculated and written.
  - Suitable as a template for adding new objectives or layouts.

### 3. `caseX_optimization.m` (repeat for your other two scripts)  
- **Purpose:** [Shortly describe the panel configuration or objective—e.g., different mesh, extra objectives, periodic boundary conditions, etc.]
- **Features:**  
  - [Summarize any differences from the other cases.]

## 🧠 Technical Highlights

- **Intelligent Batching:** Each batch processes only the minimum number of recomputed matrices by isolating changing groups.
- **DataHash Memoization:** Results of expensive operations are cached, minimizing redundant computation.
- **Automated Logging:** All output and status updates are timestamped and logged for full traceability.
- **Shell Scripting Friendly:** Clear separation of Python, MATLAB, and binary calls. Designed for workflow automation on both Windows and Linux.

## 🔍 Customization & Extension

- Add new panels by providing mesh files (`conn_caseX`, `nodes_caseX`) and updating script references.
- Add objectives (e.g., buckling, compliance) by extending the result calculation section.
- All batch/memoization logic is encapsulated for easy code modification.
